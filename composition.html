            <h4>Chris Renaud (b. 2001)</h4>
            <p>A mapping of exploring gender through sound - mixed and mastered by Lena Sutter.<br>
                -<br>
                This is part of a three movement series on the basis of a research project with fellow composer Gwenyth Lark, and inspired the words of Aja St. Germaine; a gender-fluid poet and essayist who uses writing as an outlet to explore their identity as queer and Indigenous.</p>

            <h3>"a singing song of life..."</h3>
            <h4>Chris Renaud (b. 2001)</h4>
            <p>In the spring semester of my sophomore year came an excellent opportunity for a collaborative effort between Gwen and I. I had the privilege and the honor of scoring a piece to one of her poems in early 2021. Sitting at the keyboard and improvising to these lines was an easy task, as so many of these words sung back to me as I read them. When I had set a selection of stanzas to melodic fragments, the real work began in structuring it all. That spring, this piece was born. Her poem, eerie., is as follows:</p>
            <p>The train at dusk then blares its eerie horn. <br>
                The nighttime breeze that takes the sound around <br>
                on waves of moonlit yellow, purple, black <br>
                still whispers too, and makes a fine duet- <br>
                a singing song of life that's moving on.</p>
            <p>And do we know when we're on board or just <br>
                a bystander that's watching it go by?<br>
                For we keep jumping on this train of life <br>
                and think about the past and future yet <br>
                we wonder why the present time is fast <br>
                without the thought of what's beneath our feet- <br>
                the train at dusk that blares its eerie horn. </p>
            <p>I sit there by the window and I watch <br>
                the colors of the earth and wonder where <br>
                the train is passing through <br>
                and who it speaks to. <br>
                Children listen and are lulled to sleep <br>
                while fathers lie awake and think of past <br>
                times they had heard the train and once felt young. <br>
                And mothers pace the kitchen floors and wait <br>
                for daughters, sons, still roaming round the town. <br>
                The mother's pace will quicken with the sound <br>
                of trains that blare their horn again, which means <br>
                the clock has struck an even later hour. <br>
                And then their pace will slow when they think back <br>
                to days when they were out late- just the same <br>
                as their kids now, that chase the train when it goes by,<br>
                for danger, thrill, and something fun. <br>
                A lonely stranger hears the train and feels <br>
                a sense of hope - continuance - but finds<br>
                their feet are slow to move forward with time. </p>
            <p>And there the lonely stranger walks along <br>
                the tired and the worn and rumbling tracks. <br>
                As his dark shadow melts into that of <br>
                the yellow and the purple and the black<br>
                sea of the night. He whistles his own song <br>
                and disappears with one glance to the sky.</p>

            <h3>From Point 'A' To Point You</h3>
            <h4>Chris Renaud (b. 2001)</h4>
            <p>My first impression of Eau Claire lies in these notes. My parents moved me into Aspenson Mogenson Hall in June of 2020. The months before school started my sophomore year, I was left to me, myself, and lots of time to listen to and create music. On the first day in my new apartment, I was greeted with a melody in my head. It was then I decided I needed to write it onto paper. This is the result of a melody, and a memory, expanded. From Point 'A' to Point You was my first ever studio recital piece - my debut as a composer, really. It was recorded and then eventually premiered online, four years ago.</p>

            <h3>Dazed Am I;</h3>
            <h4>Chris Renaud (b. 2001)</h4>
            <p>this is a sample track of choral solo.<br>'one night, previous to discovering this text, there was a very violent thunderstorm that I had been sleeping through, when suddenly lightning struck the fiber-optic cable next to my room. I was shell-shocked and started to scream. I continued to have nightmares afterward for a while.<br>so I decided to save that poem, at least that part of it. I wasn't sure why I kept it so long, but now it has its use.<br>the musical aspect is heavily influenced by Eric Whitacre's haunting rendition of Trent Reznor's "Hurt". It is supposed to feel eerie, dark, and sad. It is written for an alto voice. The piano mocking the vocals, the dissonance, and the major chord at the very end, (to signify hope through suffering), are completely intentional.'<br> Lyrics:</p>
            <p>"Dazed am I ; much like unto the guise<br>
                Of one stricken with dint of lightning,<br>
                Blind with the stroke, and cying here and there :<br>
                So call I for help, I not when nor where,<br>
                The pain of my fall patiently bearing :<br>
                For straight after the blaze, as is no wonder,<br>
                Of deadly noise hear I the fearful thunder."<br>
                -Sir Thomas Wyatt</p>
